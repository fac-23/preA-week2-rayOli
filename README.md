## OliRay Agency website

The challenge for the next couple of days is to build an agency website for your team.

Your website should give potential clients:

* An introduction to your agency
* Information about each member of your team
* A way to get in touch if they are interested in working with you

The potential client wants to:

* See information about each member of the team so that they can know who you are
* Browse your website on mobile, tablet, and desktop devices
* Click to navigate to different sections of your webpage
* Contact you to enquire about working with you
* Visit your website at a publicly accessible domain name

Additionally, as a visually impaired user, I want to:

* Navigate your website using keyboard controls
* Hear my screen reader describe the content on your website
